Description: GDS files are widely used to represent genotyping or
    sequence data. The GDSArray package implements the `GDSArray`
    class to represent nodes in GDS files in a matrix-like
    representation that allows easy manipulation (e.g., subsetting,
    mathematical transformation) in _R_. The data remains on disk
    until needed, so that very large files can be processed.
